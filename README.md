# Student Grades Application

## About

Using Java and MySQL we will create an application that creates three tables: Students, Courses, and Classes. The application 
enables you to add different students along with their grade and assigning them a class. A class is split by course id and 
the semester it is being offered. Using a histogram class we will also display the grades of a certain class by course grade.

TL:DR - Add students, classes, and courses into a database and display the grades of students using a piechart!

### Example of the app

Here is a quick overview on how to add a student and the pie chart that comes with it!
